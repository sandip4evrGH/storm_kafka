To address the issue of the `sshd` module going down on RHEL 9 production servers, you need to focus on **prevention**, **monitoring**, and **diagnostics**. Here's a detailed guide:

---

### **1. Preventing `sshd` from Going Down**
#### **a. Check Configuration Files**
- Ensure the `sshd_config` file is correctly configured. Look for syntax errors or unsupported options:
  ```bash
  sshd -t
  ```
  This command validates the configuration file.

#### **b. Enable Automatic Restart**
- Configure `systemd` to automatically restart the `sshd` service if it fails:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl edit sshd
  ```
  Add the following lines:
  ```ini
  [Service]
  Restart=always
  RestartSec=5s
  ```
  Save and reload the systemd configuration:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```

#### **c. Update OpenSSH**
- Ensure you are running the latest version of OpenSSH compatible with RHEL 9. Use the following command to update:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf update openssh-server
  ```

#### **d. Check SELinux and Firewall Rules**
- Ensure SELinux policies and firewall rules are not blocking `sshd`:
  ```bash
  sudo semanage port -l | grep ssh
  sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
  ```
  If needed, allow the SSH port:
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

#### **e. Resource Management**
- Check if the server is running out of resources (e.g., memory, CPU). Use tools like `top`, `htop`, or `vmstat` to monitor resource usage.

---

### **2. Monitoring `sshd`**
#### **a. Use `systemd` Logs**
- Check the `journalctl` logs for `sshd` to identify why it is failing:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u sshd
  ```

#### **b. Enable Persistent Logging**
- Ensure logs are persistent across reboots:
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
  ```

#### **c. Monitor with `ps` or `pgrep`**
- Use `ps` or `pgrep` to check if the `sshd` process is running:
  ```bash
  pgrep -l sshd
  ```

#### **d. Set Up Monitoring Tools**
- Use monitoring tools like **Nagios**, **Zabbix**, or **Prometheus** to monitor the `sshd` service. For example, with Prometheus, you can set up alerts for service failures.

#### **e. Custom Monitoring Script**
- Create a script to monitor `sshd` and restart it if necessary:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  if ! pgrep -x "sshd" > /dev/null
  then
      echo "sshd is down, restarting..." | mail -s "sshd Alert" admin@example.com
      systemctl restart sshd
  fi
  ```
  Schedule this script using `cron`:
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  ```
  Add:
  ```bash
  */5 * * * * /path/to/monitor_sshd.sh
  ```

---

### **3. Diagnosing Why `sshd` is Failing**
#### **a. Check Logs**
- Look for errors in the logs:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u sshd
  sudo cat /var/log/secure
  ```

#### **b. Analyze Core Dumps**
- If `sshd` crashes, enable core dumps for analysis:
  ```bash
  sudo ulimit -c unlimited
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
  ```
  Check the core dump location and analyze it using `gdb`.

#### **c. Investigate Resource Limits**
- Check if resource limits are causing the issue:
  ```bash
  ulimit -a
  ```
  Increase limits in `/etc/security/limits.conf` if necessary.

#### **d. Check for Conflicting Services**
- Ensure no other services are conflicting with `sshd` (e.g., another process using port 22):
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -tuln | grep :22
  ```

By implementing these steps, you can prevent `sshd` from going down, monitor its status effectively, and diagnose the root cause of failures. Let me know if you'd like help with any specific part of this process! ðŸš€




To run privileged commands without using `sudo`, you can leverage **pbrun** (Privilege Manager). The **pbrun** utility allows you to execute commands with elevated privileges based on roles that are configured for your user account. Here's how to utilize `pbrun` effectively:

---

### **1. Understand `pbrun` Basics**
- **pbrun** works as part of privilege delegation systems like **BeyondTrust (formerly PowerBroker)**.
- It requires that a **role** is predefined and assigned to your user account by an administrator.
- When you invoke `pbrun`, it escalates your privileges based on the role assigned, similar to how `sudo` operates.

---

### **2. Execute Commands Using `pbrun`**
1. **Check Role Assignment**:
   First, confirm which roles are assigned to you:
   ```bash
   pbrun -l
   ```
   This lists the roles available for your user account.

2. **Run a Command**:
   Execute a privileged command using the specific role:
   ```bash
   pbrun -u <role_name> <command>
   ```
   Replace `<role_name>` with the assigned role and `<command>` with the actual command you want to run.

   Example:
   ```bash
   pbrun -u dbadmin ls /var/lib/mysql
   ```

3. **Interactive Shell**:
   To enter an interactive shell with a specific role:
   ```bash
   pbrun -u <role_name> bash
   ```
   This allows you to run multiple commands under the role without prefixing `pbrun` each time.

---

### **3. Troubleshooting `pbrun`**
- If the role or command fails, check the logs:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/pbcommands.log
  ```
  This file records actions related to `pbrun`.

- Verify role permissions with your system administrator if necessary.

---

### **4. Best Practices**
- Use `pbrun` only for authorized tasks as outlined by your organizationâ€™s policies.
- Avoid running commands unrelated to your assigned role.
- Ensure your session times out after a specific period of inactivity for added security.

If you face any issues or need help configuring roles, reach out to your system administrator as they manage the role definitions and permissions. Let me know if you'd like to learn more about specific `pbrun` use cases! ðŸš€
